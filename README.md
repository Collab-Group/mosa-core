# MOSA Core Libraries for Ruby4
Made by WaffleBell, Jack Gannon and Nifanfa

When compiling Ruby4 you'll need to install libraries as MOSA Core is not built into Visual Studio 2019. This will install the libraries.

For **Windows ONLY:**  
-  Visual Studio 2019(with the select workloads which you can find only in the Ruby4 README)
-  VMware Workstation/Player
-  NET 5.0 and 8.0

## Installation
For **Windows:**  
-  Run `Install.bat`, and watch the magic happen

## Informations
- This currently only supports Windows
- **Important** When updating, uninstall MOSA Core first, **THEN** install the update.
- **Important** Your project name **cannot** contain spaces, GRUB does not support this sadly

This is our edition of the MOSA Project
